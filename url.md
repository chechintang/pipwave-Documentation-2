All API has the same URL, which is:

* Live Environment: [https://api.pipwave.com/payment](https://api.pipwave.com/payment)
* Test Environment: [https://staging-api.pipwave.com/payment](https://staging-api.pipwave.com/payment)

* Live Environment: [https://api.pipwave.com/v1/payment](https://api.pipwave.com/v1/payment)
* Test Environment: [https://staging-api.pipwave.com/v1/payment](https://staging-api.pipwave.com/v1/payment)
